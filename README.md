# Good Dogs with Gumnut 🐕

Gumnut is a collaborative editor that drops in anywhere, makes your products stickier, easier-to-use, plus providing full character-level attribution and history over time through its powerful database layer.

Good Dogs with Gumnut accompanies the Getting Started guide, showing you how easy it is to add Gumnut's powerful features to your site.

## I want to experience adding Gumnut to a site

Clone this repo, then head over to the Getting Started guide and follow along with the prompts.

## Just show me the completed site

> [!TIP] 
> If you just want to see Gumnut in Action, you can find live demos at https://demo.gumnut.dev

No worries! The `step-1-complete` branch implements everything in the Getting Started guide. To see it:

1. `git clone` this repo then `cd good-dogs-demo`
1. `git checkout step-1-complete`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run dev`

Now, you can open `http://localhost:3000` in two tabs; Any changes you make in one will be reflected in the other.
